## API Reference üìö

Base URL: /api

All endpoints below are relative to the server base (for example: `http://{host}/api/v1/register`). Some routes use `/api/v1` and others use `/api/payment` or `/api/host` per router mounting in `src/index.ts`.

Authentication üîê
- Two auth flows are supported in controllers:
  - User JWT access/refresh cookies (AccessCookie, RefreshCookie) which are JWTs generated with `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` / `REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET`.
  - API credentials (accessKey + secretAccessKey) signed using secrets `ACCESS_KEY_CREDENTIALS_SECRET` and `SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_CREDENTIALS_SECRET` for programmatic access.

Proxy behavior üåç (non-API subdomains)
- `src/index.ts` includes an Express route that proxies requests for non-`api` subdomains to a static S3 website: `https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/testingsuryansh.bucket/hosted-websites/{subdomain}`. If request path is `/` it will proxy to `index.html`.

Error handling ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Controllers generally return HTTP 400 for client errors and 401 for unauthorized. Responses include { success: false, message, error }.

Model summary üß©
- `User` (`src/models/user.model.ts`) ‚Äî email, password (hashed), SCSCoins, accessKey, secretAccessKey, credentialsActive, refreshToken, payment stats.
- `Payment` (`src/models/payment.model.ts`) ‚Äî paymentId, orderId, amount, userId, currency.
- `Website` (`src/models/hosting-website.model.ts`) ‚Äî websiteUrl, s3bucketUrl (select:false), websiteName, validDate, websiteType.

Queues üì¨
- `src/services/queue.service.ts` sets up BullMQ queues: Email, APIKEYS, Hosting, HostingRenewal, PaymentQueue. These are used to notify users and handle background tasks.

If you want runnable examples for each endpoint (curl, Postman collections) tell me which endpoints to prioritize and I will add example requests and expected JSON responses.
